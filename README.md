# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-TensorFlow-BitPredict-
This project focuses on time-series forecasting of Bitcoin (BTC/USD) prices using TensorFlow/Keras. Multiple deep learning models (Dense, Conv1D, LSTM, N-BEATS) and ensembles are implemented to capture temporal dependencies and improve forecasting accuracy.
